# pi-pulse

An evolving workshop for building sharp, lightweight extensions for the [Pi Coding Agent](https://pi.dev). Each extension is designed to solve one workflow problem well while remaining easy to inspect, test, and install.

The collection currently includes two observability extensions, an integrated model provider, and a coding-discipline mode:

- **Subscription usage** — provider quota, reset countdowns, and DeepSeek balance/peak pricing.
- **Live throughput** — streaming decode speed, final token rate, TTFT, and input/cache details.
- **Antigravity provider** — Google OAuth, Gemini/Claude/GPT-OSS model routing, quota diagnostics, linked-account failover, and image generation.
- **Ponytail mode** — "lazy senior dev" instructions that steer the agent toward the smallest working change, plus review/audit skills, via [`ponytail`](https://github.com/DietrichGebert/ponytail).

## Extension catalog

### Subscription usage

Supported providers:

- OpenAI Codex: 5-hour and weekly quota windows, plus banked resets
- Antigravity Pro: Gemini and third-party model quota windows
- OpenCode Go: rolling, weekly, and monthly limits
- DeepSeek API: account balance and local peak/off-peak timing
- codex-lb custom providers: effective API-key/pool limits from `/v1/usage`

Usage appears in its own responsive strip below the editor, separate from the throughput footer. Wide terminals retain progress bars; narrow terminals switch to percentages and wrap without dropping quota windows or reset countdowns. Resizing back restores your selected style automatically.

The extension refreshes around quota resets, coalesces overlapping requests, rejects stale results, and retries failures with exponential backoff. Built-in providers share a disk cache; custom codex-lb quotas stay session-local so identical provider names on different hosts/accounts cannot share quota data.

Commands:

```text
/usage
/usage toggle [bars|percent|off]
/usage refresh [active|<provider>|all]
```

`/usage refresh` defaults to the **active provider**, not unrelated saved accounts. Use `/usage refresh all` explicitly to check every configured usage provider. API failures include the server's reason and credential/permission guidance; missing credentials are reported separately.

#### codex-lb setup

Add the provider IDs to `~/.pi/agent/subscription-usage-prefs.json` (preserve any existing preferences), then reload Pi:

```json
{
  "mode": "bars",
  "codexLbProviders": ["macmini-codex"]
}
```

The IDs must match providers already configured in Pi. No key or URL duplication is needed: Pi resolves the selected model's base URL, API key, and headers at request time, including environment variables and credential commands. The base URL must end in `/v1` (proxy path prefixes are preserved); usage is fetched from the same URL plus `/usage`, without following redirects. Only explicitly listed providers are queried—an OpenAI-compatible API alone does not imply codex-lb support.

Percentages are labeled explicitly and rounded to one decimal: **Pool 5h/W used** is `100 - account_pool_usage.primary/secondary` (the API reports remaining capacity); **Limit … used** is `limits.current_value / limits.max_value × 100`. These are different metrics, not interchangeable. Pool capacity is scoped to accounts assigned to the API key and may differ from a dashboard showing all accounts. Pool data carries no reset timestamp, so only limits show reset countdowns. Key-specific limits take precedence as supplied by codex-lb; different units and model filters remain separately labeled. Null/hidden pool values are omitted, not treated as zero. `/api/codex/usage` is not used because it can return `rate_limit: null` for a valid API key. If neither pool nor limit data is available, an explicit diagnostic is shown.

### Live throughput

The footer displays a compact decode-rate reading:

```text
⚡ ~42.1 tok/s
⚡ 39.8 tok/s
```

Live values use a `characters / 4` estimate. When the provider reports output usage, the settled value uses the reported token count. `/throughput` also shows TTFT, uncached/cached input, decode duration, and measurement freshness.

Commands:

```text
/throughput
/throughput toggle [on|off]
/throughput help
```

### Antigravity provider

The Antigravity provider is built directly into `pi-pulse`. After installing or updating `pi-pulse`, authenticate and select a model:

```text
/login antigravity
/model antigravity/gemini-3.8-flash
```

Useful commands:

```text
/antigravity.models
/antigravity.usage
/antigravity.accounts
/antigravity.refresh
/antigravity.doctor
/antigravity.image <prompt>
```

Model availability depends on the signed-in Google account. It is an unofficial Google integration; review its requested OAuth permissions before approving access.

### Ponytail mode

`@dietrichgebert/ponytail` is installed as a runtime dependency; the `pi-pulse` manifest loads its Pi extension and skills. Ponytail injects its instructions before each agent turn (default mode: `full`).

```text
/ponytail [off|lite|full|ultra]
/ponytail status
/ponytail default <mode>
/ponytail-review
/ponytail-audit
/ponytail-gain
/ponytail-debt
/ponytail-help
```

The persisted default mode is stored in `~/.config/ponytail/config.json` (or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ponytail/`).

## Install

From GitHub:

```bash
pi install git:github.com/zhugez/pi-pulse
```

For local development:

```bash
pi install /home/dev/pi-pulse
```

Reload an active Pi session with:

```text
/reload
```

## Development

Requires Node.js 22.15.0 or newer.

```bash
npm install
npm run check
```

## Security and privacy

Pi extensions execute with the same operating-system permissions as Pi. The usage extension reads built-in provider credentials from environment variables or `~/.pi/agent/auth.json`. Opted-in codex-lb providers use Pi's resolved model credentials and headers. Requests go only to the corresponding quota/balance endpoints; codex-lb requests reject redirects. Review the source before installation.

Runtime state is stored under `~/.pi/agent/`:

- `subscription-usage-cache.json`
- `subscription-usage-prefs.json`
- `live-throughput-prefs.json`
- `auth.json` (Antigravity OAuth credentials managed by Pi)
- `antigravity-accounts.json` (linked Antigravity accounts)

The last two files contain sensitive access and refresh tokens. Never commit, share, or paste their contents into issues.
